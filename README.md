### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Cybersecurity Enthusiast and Developer currently diving deep into the world of **Malware Analysis** and **Network Security**. I believe in "learning by doing," which is why I spend my time building security tools and studying how systems work (and break) at a low level.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Python Network Tools** (Port Scanners, Network Monitors).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Malware Analysis, Reverse Engineering, and Threat Intelligence**.
- 🕵️‍♂️ My goal is to understand malicious software behavior to build better defenses.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love automating boring tasks with Python.

### 🧠 Learning Path

My current roadmap to becoming a Malware Analyst:

- [x] **Python for Security** (Scapy, Sockets)
- [ ] **x86/x64 Assembly Language**
- [ ] **Static Analysis** (PE Headers, Strings)
- [ ] **Dynamic Analysis** (Sandboxing, Debugging)
- [ ] **Reverse Engineering** with Ghidra/IDA
